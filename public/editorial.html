            <h1>Salut!</h1>

            <p>
              I‚Äôm the <a href="http://hood.ie/animals/#blog-bear">Blog Bear</a>!
              We have lots of good stories here at Hoodie, I love to share them!
              You might wonder what writers like me can contribute to an Open Source
              project, so please let me introduce us first!
            </p>

            <h2>
              What is Hoodie?
            </h2>

            <p>
              <a href="http://hood.ie/">Hoodie</a> is a global, <strong>inclusive
                community</strong> built around supporting the <strong>open source</strong>
                software development effort of enabling (and empowering) folks to be
                able to build applications for the web. It accomplishes this by serving
                as a complete backend for your apps; it works immediately
                ‚Äúout-of-the-box‚Äù:
                <strong>develop your frontend code, plug it into Hoodie‚Äôs
                frontend-friendly API and your app is ready.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Hoodie can refer to both the software development project, and the broader
              community. For more information about both, visit

            <h2>What is open source?</h2>

            <p>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open source software</a>
              (commonly abbreviated as OSS) is computer software with its source code made
              available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights
              to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.
              Open source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner, for
              example, by <strong>hosting code on GitHub</strong> and <strong>collaborative
              discussion on <a href="http://hood.ie/chat/">Slack and IRC</a></strong>.

            <h2>
              We are an inclusive community first
            </h2>

            <p>
              Hoodie is an open source project and community <strong>‚Äúbeyond software.‚Äù</strong>
              Our team strongly believes that open source, an integral component of modern
              technology, is changing the way people collaborate and create, and that
              extends far beyond the source code.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hoodie is built by an amazing and dedicated community consisting of developers
              and non-coding experts. It relies on strong values like diversity, empowerment
              and decentralisation. At its core Hoodie exists to empower people and make web
              development easier and more accessible to a wide range of people.
            </p>

            <p>
              We require all participation within the Hoodie project and community to act
              according to a <a href="http://hood.ie/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.
              We ask you to follow these guidelines which help steer
              <strong>our interactions</strong> and strive to keep Hoodie a positive,
              growing project and community and help us <strong>provide and ensure a safe
              environment for everyone</strong>.
            </p>

            <h2>
              What does the editorial team do?
            </h2>

            <p>
              The Editorial Team is one of many talented teams that contributes to
              Hoodie‚Äôs success. <strong>Our primary focus is Hoodies‚Äô communication with

              with what we are doing but also showcase it to everyone who has used/is
              using/wants to use Hoodie for their project. We want to make Hoodie as open
              as possible with their process and act as a source of inspiration to the
              larger Open Source community.
            </p>

            </h2>

              <strong>If you are brand new to Hoodie</strong>
              check out our <a href="http://hood.ie/contribute/">contribution guide</a>.
              We‚Äôre looking for people of all sorts, so don‚Äôt be afraid to get involved.
              If you‚Äôre passionate about contributing to a great community, we want you! üíé
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>If you are brand new to open source (including GitHub)</strong>
              first, welcome! üéâ If you haven‚Äôt checked it out yet,
              <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source">opensource.com</a>
              has some very helpful introductory resources that will give you a good
              understanding of the premise of open source and its ecosystem.
            </p>

            <p>
              To be a Hoodie contributor, you will need a GitHub account (which is free
              for open source), <a href="https://github.com/join">sign up here</a>. To
              get familar with GitHub as an online tool, they have created several
              tutorials which you can find via
              <a href="https://guides.github.com/">GitHub Guides</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              You will also need to know
              <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>,
              a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. GitHub provides a
              <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown tutorial</a>,
              and Daring Fireball has a particular thorough resource on
              <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown Syntax</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                Please be assured you will not have to have any prior knowledge of
                code or development to be a Hoodie contributor, especially within the
                Editorial team.
              </strong>
            </p>

            <h2>How to use GitHub</h2>

            <p>
              The way in which the Editorial team uses GitHub is a bit different
              from other areas on the Hoodie team.
            </p>

            <p>
              This repository (or collection) serves as the source of truth for the
              Editorial team. We use the repository in two ways:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Documentation</strong>
                of processes and resources (such as our style guide, or templates for
                types of reoccuring writing contributions)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Idea capturing</strong>
                of all editorial contributions through the
                <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/editorial/issues">Issues section</a>
                of this repository
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We do not publish anything live to the externally facing websites from this
              repository. This is a <strong>safe place to learn, ask questions, and make
                mistakes.</strong> So breathe easy. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
            </p>

            <h2>Becoming a Hoodie contributor</h2>

            <p>
              If you enjoyed contributing a first time to Hoodie, we‚Äôd love to have you onboard. üê∂
              See the
              <a href="http://hood.ie/contribute/">
                Contribution Guide for the
                overall project at hood.ie/contribute
              </a>.
              Another great way to determine if you‚Äôd like to continue on the project is
              to see the
              <a href="http://hood.ie/about/">Hoodie project goals</a> and also review
              the <a href="http://hood.ie/initiatives/">project initiatives</a>, which
              are areas of the project supported across the entire team.
            </p>

            <h3>So you want to be a contributor</h3>

            <p>
              Once you have made a contribution via GitHub (completing an issue, mergine
              a PR (pull request), etc.) we would like to invite you to be a collaborator
              on the <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq">Hoodie GitHub repository</a>.
              Please note, this is not an automated process, and requires one of the core
              maintainers to invite you ‚Äì so if you are reading this and have
              <strong>not yet been invited</strong>,
              please get ahold of one of the folks mentioned below.
            </p>

            <p>
              Becoming a collaborator simply means that you gain <strong>push</strong>
              access to projects across the repository. We ask that until you have become
              a regular collaborator, that you still follow a common review process
              typically referred to as using <strong>pull requests</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <strong>review process</strong> is begun by submitting a
              <strong>pull request</strong> back to the original version (branch) of a
              repository. Many, many, many amazing tutorials have been created about the
              pull request process so I won‚Äôt recap that here, but instead point you to
              the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">GitHub tutorial</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              For Hoodie, pull requests need to be approved by
              <strong>two other contributors</strong>,
              before being merged into the project.
            </p>
