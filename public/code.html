            <h1>Moin!</h1>

            <p>
              I’m the <a href="http://hood.ie/animals/#dev-beaver">Dev Beaver</a> and am
              happy to welcome you on Hoodie’s Code Team.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our main objective is to make Hoodie’s code as easy to contribute to as
              possible. If there is something that doesn’t make sense, it’s on us, please
              let us know and we will try to clarify it for you and document it for
              everyone else for the future.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our Code Team lead is <a href="https://twitter.com/gr2m/">Gregor</a>. He
              keeps the overview of everything code and helps everyone interested to
              contribute to or help maintain Hoodie’s codebase. Say hi <a href="https://twitter.com/gr2m">on twitter</a>
              or <a href="http://hood.ie/chat">on our Hoodie Chat</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>What is Hoodie?</h2>

            <p>
              Hoodie, at its core, is a server that comes with its own database and a
              client API. It basically allows you to build web applications with just
              HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and use the <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-client#api">Hoodie Client AP</a>
              for user authentication and data persistance.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you want to understand how things work internally, a good place to start
              is the <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie/tree/master/server">Hoodie Server README</a>.
              But don’t get intimidated by all of Hoodie’s code. We worked hard to split
              up the code base into smaller modules, and if you want to start to contribute,
              you can start contributing to each of this small modules, without the need
              to understand all of Hoodie. Each module has their own documentation, tests
              and instructions on how to get going.
            </p>

            <h2>How to contribute?</h2>

            <p>
              We have a <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/camp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ACode+label%3A%22up+for+grabs%22">list of prepared code issues</a> on our camp repository.
              If you want to jump right in, these are for you :) Some of them are reserved
              for <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/camp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ACode+label%3A%22up+for+grabs%22+label%3A%22Your+First+PR%22">first-time Hoodie Contributors</a>.
              We also list the issues below.
            </p>

            <p>
              We documented all our conventions on <a href="https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing code to Hoodie</a>,
              and if you continue contributing, we’d like you to read through it. But if
              you are new to Hoodie, please don’t worry, start your first pull request,
              we are more than happy to help you out with things like code style. Don’t
              let it keep you from contributing in the first place, we are here to help.
            </p>

              them, respond to issues make sure the problem can be reproduced and has
              enough context to work on, and helps with code questions in our
